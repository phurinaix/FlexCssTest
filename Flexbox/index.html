                        Russian millionaire Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was added to a US Treasury Department sanctions 
                        list in 2015 for his alleged dealings with the Assad government.
                        He denies wrongdoing, and stepped back from FIDE to try to resolve the issue.
                        But FIDE says Swiss bank UBS closed its accounts as he is still sanctioned.
                        A letter from the Lausanne-based FIDE's treasurer, Adrian Siegel, acknowledged the issue was 
                        "a serious problem" that had "severely damaged" the organisation's business dealings.
